This data was produced through simulation in the dissertation (SANTO, G. C. M., 2020). The dataset is created based on the work in (WANG et al., 2018). The transfer functions adopted in the simulation were directly extracted from (WANG et al., 2018 apud YU et al., 2011), as well as the simulation idea, where similar signals were produced.
