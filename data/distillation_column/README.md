This dataset was produced through simulation in the dissertation (SANTO, G. C. M., 2020). The transfer functions adopted in the simulation were directly extracted from (WOOD; BERRY, 1973) and the operating conditions adopted were extracted from (JULIANI, 2017). The simulation idea was based in (PATEL, 2016), with similar signals being produced.
